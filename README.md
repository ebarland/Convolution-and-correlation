# Convolution-and-correlation
Computes the convolution and the cross-corellation of two identical signals with delay in between

This python script generates two square wave signals, where one is delayed halv the cycle time of the other.
it then uses cross-correlation to identify the similarities, and finally convolutes the two signals.
